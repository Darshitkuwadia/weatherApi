# WeatherApp

- Create with Node.js and Express.
- Creativity is encouraged.

## Set-up

- Install Node :  http://nodejs.org/
- Get an API key :  
  - The Dark Sky requires developer  registration to leverage their free API.
  - Upon registration you will receive a key, which is required for subsequent requests.
  - A sample API request: https://api.darksky.net/forecast/4dd9e73d6fc4af3517231c08979bc1f2/37.8267,-122.4233

### Install JavaScript IDE (Optional)

- Optionally install WebStorm with the 30 day trail or any text editor of your choice (i.e. http://www.sublimetext.com).

### Requirements

- Create an application that obtains weather data for Campbell-CA, Omaha-NE, Austin-TX and Timonium-MD.
- Display the weather results in a table and omit any locations that fail to return data.

- Create a middleware on the server‚Äêside that will log to the console all parameters passed to the server via different methods of inputting data from a web app to the server (form, URL, etc). For example, if the URL was http://localhost:8000/weather?name=foo it would log the fact that the name=foo was passed.

- Use appropriate variable names and add comments.

- Write unit tests for your code using a framework of your choice.
  - Jest is a popular one.
